#  API example

Requirements for build:
 - Openjdk15
 - Maven
 - Docker
 - docker-compose

For build the docker image we need to have the fat jar on the target folder.


Please look at file for [build](https://github.com/joaoferreira1985/hello-world-api/blob/master/services/hello-world-api/README.md)

Alternative after build we can use the docker-compose command for start the application locally
